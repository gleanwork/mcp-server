## MCP Client Configuration

To configure this MCP server in your MCP client (such as Claude Desktop, Windsurf, Cursor, etc.), run [@gleanwork/configure-mcp-server](https://github.com/gleanwork/mcp-server/tree/main/packages/configure-mcp-server) passing in your client, token and instance.

```bash
# Configure for Cursor
npx @gleanwork/configure-mcp-server --client cursor --token your_api_token --instance instance_name

# Configure for Claude Desktop
npx @gleanwork/configure-mcp-server --client claude --token your_api_token --instance instance_name
```

For more details see: [@gleanwork/configure-mcp-server](https://github.com/gleanwork/mcp-server/tree/main/packages/configure-mcp-server).

### Manual MCP Configuration

To manually configure an MCP client (such as Claude Desktop, Windsurf, Cursor, etc.), add the following configuration to your MCP client settings:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "glean": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@gleanwork/local-mcp-server"],
      "env": {
        "GLEAN_SERVER_URL": "<your server URL from Glean admin panel>",
        "GLEAN_API_TOKEN": "<glean api token>"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Example values:
- `GLEAN_SERVER_URL`: `https://acme-corp-be.glean.com/` (copy from your Glean admin panel)
- `GLEAN_API_TOKEN`: Your API token from Glean settings

Alternative configuration (legacy - note that `-be` is automatically appended):
```json
"env": {
  "GLEAN_INSTANCE": "acme-corp",  // becomes https://acme-corp-be.glean.com/
  "GLEAN_API_TOKEN": "<glean api token>"
}
```

### Local Development

For local development, you can use a `.env` file to store your credentials:

1. Copy the example environment file:
```bash
cp ../../.env.example ../../.env
```

2. Edit `.env` with your values:
```bash
# .env
GLEAN_SERVER_URL=https://your-company-be.glean.com/
GLEAN_API_TOKEN=your_api_token_here
```

3. Run the server locally:
```bash
npm run build
node build/index.js
```

3. For use with MCP clients during development:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "glean-dev": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/path/to/packages/local-mcp-server/build/index.js"]
    }
  }
}
```

The server will automatically load environment variables from the `.env` file.

### Debugging

Since MCP servers communicate over stdio, debugging can be challenging. We recommend using the [MCP Inspector](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/inspector), which is available as a package script:

```bash
npm run inspector
```

The Inspector will provide a URL to access debugging tools in your browser.
